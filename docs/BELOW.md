# Below — the gate

Firmware → loader (off the disk) → Kindling spark. House light (G15–G61) is on.
Linux ELF waits on its own gate. Gleam ELF (our headers, house calls) is G55. This file staying green is still the law.

Run: `make below`  
Ten times: `make below-ten`

Limine (`make serial`) is a **crutch**, out of this gate.

| G49 | WRITE waits for NAND; a stalled pipe is healed before `roll` | efi-keeper still `the name is cut` | yes |
| G50 | Quiet BOT — finish the WRITE before any TUR; `roll` retries glean | efi-keeper still `the name is cut` | yes |
| G51 | `cast` recasts the fire; `r` at ingle/leaf | ingle-cast / ingle-leaf-cast / efi-cast `the fire is recast` | yes |

| G60 | Tiny pane — left text, 2× Grove on the right; flush form-feed homes | ingle-leaf: `the pane is open`; efi-grow extra `q`; efi-glass row 2 | yes |
| G61 | Pane stands — GOT in the load; bunny paints CR2; a dead pane fails | ingle-leaf: `the pane is open` then `the pane is shut`; never `the spark went out` | yes |

Firmware extras (this sitting): VGA mode 3 by registers, 8×16 plane-2 font (`ok font` in `make below`), PIC ICW1–4, real-mode IVT + 32/64-bit IDT (`cerne-fw: trap`), 64-bit `lgdt`, `make below` includes `fw-trap`. Well maps through 3 GiB (`PDPT[0..2]`); `PDPT[3]` stays free for the LAPIC.

House calls (Gleam-only, not Linux): `docs/HOUSECALLS.md`. First set: `yield` / `exit` / `write(fd 1-2)` / `read(fd 0)` / `sleep` / `time` / `glean` / `stow` / `spawn` / `flush` + shut `grant` (`-EAGAIN`). `glean` takes the cairn first, then a live FAT volume's root by Gleam name. `spawn` gathers a named spark the same way (64 KiB raw `nasm -f bin`, or a Gleam ELF64 `ET_EXEC` up to 256 KiB). `stow` lays a leaf the same way (WRITE(10)+READ(10) compare on FAT; KINDLING `85C7-AA81` only; FAT32 creates a missing or empty root file, and grows or shrinks a present file to `len`). Spark `leaf` tells that page and waits for `q` (smoor) or `r` (recast). Paved `ingle` kindles `keeper` first; last word 0 greets `hand`, kindles `gleam` after the fire is lit (flush proof; a miss is quiet), then `bud` (grow proof; a miss is quiet), then `pane` (tiny TUI; a miss is quiet), then `leaf`, and writes `the light remains` when that spark smoors. `flush` with a leading form-feed homes the left text pane. Grove and flame sit on the right (GOP 2×). `keeper` is Setup Assistant on an empty book and the hall later (`roll`/`enlist`/`choose`/`dismiss`). After a name is taken it writes `the name is cut` and `the word sleeps in the twin`; a choose writes `this fire knows you`; a dismiss writes `that name is given back`. Leaves `hands` and `twin` are the same roster sealed twice. A lone leaf is wax; two live seals that disagree split. No-Light `exit` paints serial and the glass `kindling: gleam exit N`. `write` also paints the glass (VGA / GOP). Happy serial unchanged; `house-test` image prints `kindling: house ok`; `spawn-test` prints `kindling: spawn ok`, the second-leaf, then `stayed`. Guest `#UD`/`#PF`/`#GP` print `kindling: trap N` and `the spark went out`; the glass names a critter, and a bunny also paints CR2; with a Light, `spawn` returns `-EIO`. After the well the glass shows the Grove glyph + title. EFI prints Grove on ConOut before touching GOP (IdeaPad has no COM1; Insyde hung inside GOP open).

Out of gate: FAT16 create, mkdir, unlink, a TUI that saves to `page`, 3×/4× glyphs, SMP APs, LA57 well, resume at a fault RIP, UHCI/EHCI/mice, deep hubs (xHCI HID boot keyboard, one hub hop, BOT MSC READ CAPACITY, READ(10) of a FAT boot sector, WRITE(10) of a KINDLING sector, `glean` of a named leaf from the volume root, `spawn` of a named spark from that root, and `stow` of a named leaf onto that root — including FAT32 create of a missing or empty file — are in-gate; 8042 poll stays). KINDLOG is in-gate for the book (`KLOG` superblock, seals at fixed LBAs). Guest traps smoor into the Light (G31); ring-0 traps stay fatal. The store dump after `msc` names every partition (`fat` / `kindlog` / `empty` / `other`). `grant` stays shut.
